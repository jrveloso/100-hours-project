This project is a fullstack web application that lets NBA fans create an account, create a list to track their favorite players' stats, share their basketball analysis with other fans, and keep track of game scoreboards.

My goal was to construct a create a platform for NBA fans to write and share their own analysis, with the ability to view stats integrated into the same application. I wanted a clean/minimal aesthetic that would evoke basketball, the hardwood floor it's played on, and allow for responsive designs. I also focused on providing a seamless authentication experience for users, and implementing an MVC structure for future scalability.

## Optimizations
My next steps for improving this project would be implementing an autocomplete search bar (works with correctly spelled and full player names currently), player shot charts, a more reliable api that would provide this year's player stats (currently using data.nba and cdn.nba). Would Google Auth for users who prefer to login with their google credentials, and transition from EJS to React for 'Views' files for component-based frontend structure.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to create a full stack application that delivers consistent quality throughout all its features.
