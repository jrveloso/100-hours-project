This project is a fullstack web application that lets NBA fans create an account, create a list to track their favorite players' stats, share their basketball analysis with other fans, and keep track of game scoreboards.

My goal was to construct a create a platform for NBA fans to write and share their own analysis, with the ability to view stats integrated into the same application. I wanted a clean/minimal aesthetic that would evoke basketball, the hardwood floor it's played on, and allow for responsive designs. 

Regarding project structure, I went with an MVC architecture. This allowed for less headaches with debugging, better modularity across the project, and an organized structure for future scalability. 

I also focused on providing a seamless authentication experience for users with Passport.js.

## Optimizations
My sportradar api free trial has ended so I'm currently researching other ways to obtain updated statistics (other APIs or via webscraping). Looking to add Google Auth for users who prefer to login with their Google credentials, and refactor the project in React to take advantage of it's speed and component-based structure.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the usefulness of making your code more modular and reusable via partials. I came to really appreciate the idea of separation of concerns for your application, like using MongoDB for file storage or Cloudinary for photo storage to offload those pieces from your application. Overall, this was a really fun and challenging project that allowed me to combine my love for the NBA and my software skills.
